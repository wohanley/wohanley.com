        <p>I'm a lawyer and computer programmer interested in access to justice, knowledge management, and the pragmatics of code. I was called to the bar of British Columbia in 2024, and my earlier undergraduate studies were in computer science and mathematics. I have five years of experience as a software developer, working mainly on web applications for data visualization and education, and one year working in law. You can look at some of my <a href="/posts">posts</a> or <a href="https://notes.wohanley.com">notes</a> to see the kinds of things I'm interested in, or you can <a href="mai&#108;to&#58;&#37;6D&#101;&#64;&#119;&#111;h&#37;61&#37;6E%&#54;&#67;e&#121;&#46;com">send me an email</a>.</p>

            <h3>Articling Clinician, Everyone Legal Clinic<span class="date">May 2023 to May 2024</span></h3>
            <p>I articled at the <a href="https://everyonelegal.ca/">Everyone Legal Clinic</a>, a public interest law teaching clinic and practice incubator operated by Access Pro Bono through the LSBC Innovation Sandbox. I had full carriage of files from intake interviews through delivery of legal services under a fixed-price, limited-scope model. I was called to the British Columbia bar in May 2024.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I managed files from initial intake through completion of legal services, working in a fixed-fee, limited-scope practice model.</li>
              <li>My work was highly varied and included writing memos, settlement offers, and demand letters; preparing and filing Notices of Claim and other court documents; and appearing before the Residential Tenancy Branch.</li>
              <li>I also worked for Access Pro Bono's Summary Advice Program as an intake coordinator and technical consultant on intake systems. Following my interventions, there were dramatic improvements in response times for client inquiries.</li>

            <h3>Computable Contracts Developer, Stanford CodeX<span class="date">January 2022 to January 2023</span></h3>
            <p>I worked for <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics/">CodeX</a>, the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics, developing tools for the implementation of computational law. I was particularly focused on logic programming for computable insurance contracts, but CodeX is a large and diverse group, and I worked with lawyers, engineers, and academics on a wide variety of projects:
              <ul>
                <li>I worked on <a href="https://github.com/codexstanford/ipdl">interpreters</a> and <a href="https://github.com/codexstanford/vscode-yscript">developer</a> <a href="https://github.com/codexstanford/vscode-epilog">tools</a> for the declarative modelling of insurance contracts. I presented <a href="https://wohanley.com/posts/visual-yscript/">one such tool</a> at the <a href="https://popl23.sigplan.org/home/prolala-2023">Programming Languages and the Law</a> workshop at POPL 2023.</li>
                <li>I worked with municipal staff in the Bay Area on digitizing ordinances, aiming to provide a better interface to the rules than the current approach based on paper forms.</li>
                <li>I was generally available to help with implementation of CodeX fellows' ideas, and I often helped with legal design processes by producing interactive prototypes.</li>

            <p>I worked for the University of Victoria Access to Justice Centre for Excellence, assisting with a variety of projects at BC courts and tribunals aimed at improving access to justice:
              <ul>
                <li>I assisted with rule reform projects at BC courts and tribunals.</li>
                <li>I worked as a teaching assistant, helping to redesign and deliver the Access to Justice class at the University of Victoria. We connected students with local legal services organizations and incorporated studio practice and user-centered design techniques into the course. We aimed to teach students to see access to justice as a problem that it is possible to work meaningfully toward solving.</li>
                <li> I conducted secondary research into topics including empiricism in the justice system, human-centered legal design, and legal education, especially education about legal technology.</li>
                <li>I helped to facilitate ACE’s May 2019 Access to Justice Metrics Colloquium, gathering information on the data available from a selection of justice system actors. Much of my research in 2019 revolved around access to justice metrics and analyzing justice data.</li>

            <p>I built and maintained web-based software tools supporting Zymeworks’ scientific researchers. I contributed to improving testing and review processes and mentoring of newer team members, particularly by introducing generative testing and helping other developers use generative techniques in their own work. The team was careful to keep separate codebases independent and use the best tool for the job, so I gained experience with a wide range of technologies, including React, Redux, Elm, Go, and Python.</p>

Joining a team light on process and explicit standards, I drove efforts to introduce code review and automated unit testing alongside my normal feature ownership responsibilities, leading to an order of magnitude increase in the overall number of tests. I was also the technical lead on an Ionic-based mobile version of our Angular apps.</p>

I designed and built features on a .NET backend and delivered them to over 3.6 million users.
