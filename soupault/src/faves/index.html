    <p>These are some of my favourite movies, books, etc. They're in no particular order. You could also look at my five-star ratings for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/37883668?sort=rating">books</a> or <a href="https://letterboxd.com/whohanley/films/diary/rated/5/">movies</a>.</p>
    <ul class="faves">
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maborosi">Maborosi</a>: A man dies in an apparent suicide, to the shock of his wife, who eventually remarries and moves to a small fishing village. The imaginary and the real, the expected and the actual, the present dead and the absent living. I like every Kore-eda I've seen, but this is my favourite.</li>
      <li><a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer">... of the Killer</a>: A New Wave zine publisher has a series of bizarre encounters with eccentric psychopaths. Funny, thoughtful, actually pretty scary.</li>
      <li><a href="https://discoelysium.com/">Disco Elysium</a>: A cop with uncertain but strongly-held political convictions investigates (1) where it all went wrong, with his ex but also with his life more generally, but also with the world at large, in a Historical sense but also metaphysically speaking, and (2) a murder.</li>
      <li><a href="https://dominoclub.itch.io/">Domino Club</a>: Can't find the post about the taste of potato chips being “wet crunch”, but I want to describe Domino Club's output as wet, crunchy videogames. Ditherpunk, experimental, lo-fi, body horror sometimes, jarring and adventurous.</li>
      <li><a href="https://achewood.com/">Achewood</a>: “Cooome and get it! Come get your fresh public wine!”</li>
      <li><a href="https://killsixbilliondemons.com/">Kill Six Billion Demons</a>: I read every new KSBD immediately no matter what else I have going on.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Skin_(2013_film)">Under the Skin</a>: A body-snatching alien and a series of grim necessities. Or were they necessary? Or was she an alien?</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris,_Texas_(film)">Paris, Texas</a>: A long-disappeared man emerges from the desert, trying to go home again.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Tomorrow_(film)">World of Tomorrow</a>: A third-degree clone travels back through time to meet her original and collect a memory. Dense, bleak, sentimental.</li>
      <li><a href="https://inthewalls.itch.io/bee">Emily Short</a>: One of the great masters of interactive fiction. She is consistently generations ahead and it's hard to pick a favourite work, but I have a soft spot for Bee.</li>
      <li><a href="https://birdland.camp/">Birdland</a>: Coming-of-age IF. Funny, zany, charming. The Bell Park stories are good too.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabriel">Sabriel</a>: A young necromancer is called to adventure. Sabriel film adaptation is on my list of vanity projects for if I ever somehow become a billionaire.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Davis">Mrs. Davis</a>: There is no Lindelof show I wouldn't recommend (except Lost, because it is, unaccountably, the only one I haven't seen), but Mrs. Davis is probably my favourite for leaning into the wackiness.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rings_of_Saturn">The Rings of Saturn</a>: Walking around, looking at things, feeling unaccountably bad. The iron laws of inevitable decline. Nothing but decay and ugliness is possible, and yet...</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_the_Garden_Wall">Over the Garden Wall</a>: Flawless. Rewatch every October.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(VanderMeer_novel)">Annihilation</a>: “Perhaps so many journals had piled up in the lighthouse because on some level most came, in time, to recognize the futility of language. Not just in Area X but against the rightness of the lived-in moment, the instant of touch, of connection for which words were such a sorrowful disappointment, so inadequate an expression of both the finite and the infinite.” The movie was good too.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Zwicky">Jan Zwicky</a>: The bulk of Jan Zwicky's work is around what she calls lyric philosophy: meaning and resonance, truth and music. From her first book, Wittgenstein Elegies:
        <pre class="prose"><blockquote>We walk into a room, our feet are bare.
Books, papers, letters, piled about,
discarded tie and random pencils,
picture crooked on the wall. At first
we think, “A mess! What disarray!
It should be straightened up!”
But then we look around and recognize
that no, no thing can be disturbed. Even the dust is in its place.</blockquote></pre>

        Songs for Relinquishing the Earth is my favourite of her books.</li>
      <li><a href="https://furkleindustries-homepage.s3.amazonaws.com/spy-intrigue/index.html">Spy Intrigue</a>: In which you show up for your first day of spy school and are informed that the other spies recently attended an NHL game together at which they all contracted mumps and died, making you the Master Spy.
        <blockquote>
          <p>"LET'S GO SOMEWHERE A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE," SHE SAYS</p>
          <p>SHE PULLS YOU TOWARDS THE LOCKERS AND INSIDE THEIR IMPOSSIBLY LARGE EXTENT, AND YOU LAUGH SO FULLY AND SO CARELESSLY THAT IT SOUNDS FOREIGN, ECHOING OFF THE LOCKER'S WALLS AS IF IT CAME FROM A SPEAKER</p>
          <p>YOU CANNOT REMEMBER THE LAST TIME YOU LAUGHED FROM YOUR CHEST AND NOT FROM SOMEWHERE DISTANT AND DELIBERATE WITHIN YOUR BRAIN</p>
          <p>SHE LOOKS AT YOU, NEWLY WOUNDED, AND YOU REALIZED THAT YOU'VE LAUGHED IN HER FACE</p>
          <p>IT'S NOT</p>
          <p>IT'S</p>
          <p>AND YOU GIVE UP TRYING TO EXPLAIN AND YOU PULL HER AGAINST YOU, HARD, AND LIFT HER SHIRT OVER HER HEAD</p>
          <p>
            <a href="#">ASK TO GO DOWN ON HER</a>
            <br/>
            <a href="#">STEAL HER ID CARD</a>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        This passage comes from an arc in which you marry a security guard and live happily with her for many years in an eventually successful effort to steal her ID card.

        <blockquote>every night you wander the city like an inconsolable revenant, calling after her, shaking a tin of food, making the same "come here" noises you never realized could contain grief at all. but there is a socket in everything for grief, and no matter how small it always manages to effect a shift in space and time, from pleasantry into some shadowy, twilit thing</blockquote>

        From a flashback to when your cat went missing, before you were a spy. If you aren't sold on this game yet then more quotes will probably only make it worse.</li>
