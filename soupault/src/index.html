    <p>Welcome to the personal website of William O'Hanley.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm a lawyer and computer programmer based in Vancouver. You can read my <a href="/resume">CV</a> if you're interested in my professional background.</p>
      <p>I do a lot of programming odds and ends, and I tend to think of myself as a “computer person” per <a href="http://mh.federated.wiki/view/welcome-visitors/view/mh-books">Hales</a> and <a href="https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/">Agre</a>. I'm fairly Web-oriented overall and I use Emacs for a lot of things, especially <a href="/posts/org-setup">note-taking</a>. I like Clojure.</p>
      <p>I've produced a lot of text over the years in <a href="https://notes.wohanley.com">a personal knowledge base</a>, various and infrequent <a href="/posts">posts</a>, <a href="/law/outlines">notes from law school</a>, and <label class="text-clickable" for="logs-button">media logs</label>.</p>
      <p>If there's something you think I'd be interested in, or you're in Vancouver and you want to get a coffee, or you want to contact me for whatever other reason, you can <a href="mailto:%6De@woh%61%6E%6Cey.com">send me an email</a>. I like getting email! I won't be annoyed. Or you could add something to <a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/MguL8M0I7lJ9i636WLFM">the guestbook</a> if you just want to say hi. I'm also usually at Sunset Beach in the morning.</p>
