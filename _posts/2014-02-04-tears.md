This is something I made after a few experiments with Processing. The top layer is a cellular automaton and the bottom reflects calls to the cells' live and die methods. I know everyone always tells you to check out the [source](https://github.com/wohanley/tears "Tears"), but this time I really mean it. It's very easy to tweak some of the constants in the code and get new patterns out of the automaton, so give it a try!
