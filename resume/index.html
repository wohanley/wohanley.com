            <p>I have three diverse years of software development experience, from creating <a href="#zymeworks">bespoke</a> and <a href="#trade-me">large-scale</a> web applications, to making emerging wireless technology available to <a href="#upei-research">medical professionals</a>, to <a href="#ctu">teaching</a> computer science in China, to being downright <a href="https://twitter.com/movesuggestions">weird</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tswift_tunes">silly</a>. You can see a bunch of my experiments <a href="/trivia">here</a>. I'm a quick and enthusiastic learner, so if you want me to do something I haven't done before, don't be afraid to <a href="mai&#108;to&#58;&#37;6D&#101;&#64;&#119;&#111;h&#37;61&#37;6E%&#54;&#67;e&#121;&#46;com">ask!</a></p>
